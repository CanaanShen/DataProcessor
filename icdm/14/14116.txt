In this paper we study a very natural type of summary: the original set of vertices is partitioned into a small number of supernodes connected by superedges to form a complete weighted graph. The superedge weights are the edge densities between vertices in the corresponding supernodes. To quantify the dissimilarity between the original graph and a summary, we adopt the \emph{reconstruction error} and the \emph{cut-norm error}. By exposing a connection between graph summarization and geometric clustering problems (i.e., $k$-means and $k$-median), we develop the \emph{first polynomial-time approximation algorithms} to compute the best possible summary of a certain size under both measures. We discuss how to use our summaries to store a (lossy or lossless) compressed graph representation and to approximately answer a large class of queries about the original graph, including adjacency, degree, eigenvector centrality, and triangle and subgraph counting. Using the summary to answer queries is very efficient as the running time to compute the answer depends on the number of vertices in the summary, rather than the size of the original graph.
