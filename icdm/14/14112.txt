Statistical regularities can be efficiently exploited to overcome the limitations of the inherently incomplete knowledge bases distributed across the Web. This paper focuses on the problem of predicting missing class-memberships and property values of individual resources in Web ontologies. We propose a transductive inference method for inferring missing properties about individuals: given a class-membership/property value prediction problem, we address the task of identifying relations encoding similarities between individuals by means of a finite-set Gaussian Process regression model, and efficiently propagating knowledge across their relations. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.
