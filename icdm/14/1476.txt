Realizing the natural setting of social nodes associated with dual view information, i.e., the local node characteristics and the global network influence, we present a novel model that explores graph regularization techniques and integrates such information to achieve improved prediction performance. In particular, our prediction model is built upon the information-theoretic framework that encodes an uncertainty regularization term in the conventional empirical risk minimization principle. Though taking advantage of the information from both the local characteristics and the global network structure, the final inference of the role or statues achieves minimum an empirical loss on the labeled set, as well as a minimum uncertainty on the unlabeled social nodes. We perform extensive empirical study using the real-wold data from popular social network sites and compare with representative peer approaches. The experiment results on three real social network data sets show that the proposed model greatly outperforms a number of baseline models and is able to effectively infer in a wide range of scenarios.
