Since comparing two objects is the simplest type of queries in order to measure the relevance of objects, the problem of aggregating pairwise comparisons to obtain a global ranking has been widely studied. Furthermore, ranking with pairwise comparisons has recently received a lot of attention in crowdsourcing systems where binary queries can be used effectively to make assessments faster for precise ranks. In order to learn a ranking model, a training set of queries as well as their correct labels are supplied and a machine learning algorithm is used to find the appropriate parameters of the ranking model with respect to the labels. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model for learning multiple latent rankings using pairwise comparisons. Our novel model can capture multiple hidden rankings underlying the pairwise comparisons. Based on the model, we develop an efficient inference algorithm to learn multiple latent rankings as well as an active learning algorithm to update the model parameters in crowdsourcing systems whenever each pairwise comparison is observed. The performance study with synthetic and real-life data sets confirms the effectiveness of our model and inference algorithms.
