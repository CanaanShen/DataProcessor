However, because the best solution is typically the Nearest Neighbor algorithm with the relatively expensive Dynamic Time Warping as the distance measure, successful deployments on resource constrained devices remain elusive. Moreover, the recent explosion of interest in wearable devices, which typically have limited computational resources, has created a growing need for very efficient classification algorithms. A commonly used technique to glean the benefits of the Nearest Neighbor algorithm, without inheriting its undesirable time complexity, is to use the Nearest Centroid algorithm. However because of the unique properties of (most) time series data, the centroid typically does not resemble any of the instances, an unintuitive and underappreciated fact. In this work we show that we can exploit a recent result to allow meaningful averaging of "warped" times series, and that this result allows us to create ultra-efficient Nearest "Centroid" classifiers that are at least as accurate as their more lethargic Nearest Neighbor cousins.
