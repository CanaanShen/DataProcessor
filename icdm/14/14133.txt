Better and more accurate estimation methods result in improved online experience for users, as only relevant and interesting ads are shown, and may also lead to large benefits for advertisers, as targeted users are more likely to click or make a purchase. In this paper we address this important problem, and propose an approach for improved estimation of ad click or conversion probability based on a sequence of user's online actions, modeled using state-of-the-art Hidden Conditional Random Fields (HCRF) model. In addition, in order to address the sparsity issue at the input side of the HCRF model, we propose to learn a distributed, low-dimensional representation of user actions through a directed skip-gram model, a novel deep architecture suitable for sequential data. The experimental results on a real-world data set comprising thousands of online user sessions collected at servers of a large internet company clearly indicate the benefits and the potential of the proposed approach, which outperformed the competing state-of-the-art algorithms and obtained significant improvements in terms of retrieval measures.
