We define PHI as an overall score of personal health status based on a complement probability of health risks. The health risks are calculated based on the cause of death (COD) dataset that is linked to the GME dataset. Especially, the highest health risk is revealed as the cases that people who have been taking GME for some years and then passed away for medical reasons. Our motivation is that people take regular medical examinations mostly not for discovering diseases but for having a peace of mind regarding their health status. Therefore, it is important to give them an overall feedback with respect to all the health indicators that have been ranked against the whole population. The proposed framework consists of methods in data pre-processing, feature extraction and selection, and model selection. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated by a set of comprehensive experiments base on the records of 102,258 participants. As the first of this kind, our work provides a baseline for the further researches.
