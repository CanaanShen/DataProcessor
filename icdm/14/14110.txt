RHD is important for applications such as crime analysis, where it may focus search for location of a crime source, e.g. the home of a serial criminal. RHD is challenging because of the large number of candidate rings and the high computational cost of the statistical significance test. Previous statistically significant hot spot detection techniques (e.g., SaTScan) identify contiguous circular or rectangular areas, but cannot discover rings with holes. This paper proposes a dual grid based pruning (DGP) approach to detect ring-shaped hotspots of activities. Case study on a real crime data confirms the superiority of DGP output over SaTScan. Experiments on synthetic data show that DGP improves the computational cost of a naïve approach substantially.
