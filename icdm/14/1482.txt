NMF based multi- view clustering algorithms have shown their competitiveness among different multi-view clustering algorithms. However, NMF fails to preserve the locally geometrical structure of the data space. In this paper, we propose a multi-manifold regularized nonnegative matrix factorization framework (MMNMF) which can preserve the locally geometrical structure of the manifolds for multi-view clustering. MMNMF regards that the intrinsic manifold of the dataset is embedded in a convex hull of all the viewsâ?? manifolds, and incorporates such an intrinsic manifold and an intrinsic (consistent) coefficient matrix with a multi- manifold regularizer to preserve the locally geometrical structure of the multi-view data space. We use linear combination to construct the intrinsic manifold, and propose two strategies to find the intrinsic coefficient matrix, which lead to two instances of the framework. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing NMF based algorithms for multi- view clustering.
