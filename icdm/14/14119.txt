In this paper, we tackle this problem with a multi-task learning (MTL) framework. To take the temporal nature of the problem into consideration, we divide the regression problem into a set of sub-tasks of distinct time periods to model the dynamic changes of link costs. The problem can then be treated in a multi-task learning framework, and temporal dynamics can be modeled as task relationships. To account for the extremely high costs in rush hours which may be regarded as outliers and influence the learned model significantly, we propose a novel regularization term in which we exploit the block â??â??,1 norm to augment the robustness of the model. In addition, we incorporate the spatial smoothness over road links and thus achieve a spatial-temporal framework for trajectory regression. To solve the convex but non-smooth problem efficiently, we propose an accelerated proximal algorithm which is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum. We also investigate the issue of link directions which has not been considered before in previous works. Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms while capturing the anomalous rush periods efficiently.
