We propose a noise-resistant feature selection algorithm by capturing multi-perspective correlations. Our proposed approach, called Noise-Resistant Unsupervised Feature Selection (NRFS), is based on multi-perspective correlation that reflects the importance of feature with respect to noise-resistant instance representatives and various global trends using spectral decomposition. In this way, the model concisely captures a wide variety of local patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.
