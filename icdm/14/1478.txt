In this paper, we address several open challenge of big data stream classification, including high volume, high velocity, high dimensionality, high sparsity, and high class-imbalance. Many existing studies in data mining literature solve data stream classification tasks in a batch learning setting, which suffers from poor efficiency and scalability when dealing with big data. To overcome the limitations, this paper investigates an online learning framework for big data stream classification tasks. Unlike some existing online data stream classification techniques that are often based on first-order online learning, we propose a framework of Sparse Online Classification (SOC) for data stream classification, which includes some state-of-the-art first-order sparse online learning algorithm as a special case and allows us to derive a new effective second-order online learning algorithm for data stream classification. In addition, we also propose a new cost-sensitive sparse online learning algorithm by extending the framework with application to tackle online anomaly detection tasks where class distribution of data could be very imbalanced. We also analyze the theoretical bounds of the proposed method, and finally conduct an extensive set of experiments, in which encouraging results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms in comparison to a family of state-of-the-art techniques on a variety of data stream classification tasks.
