A central question in these platforms is how to align the right products with the right investors, thus help investors to make better decisions. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to modeling the credit of products and borrowers from an economic perspective. However, these global models are only exploratory in nature and are not practical in the real world. In this paper, we focus on the personalized investment recommendation by reconstructing the two steps for investment decision making: what to buy and how much money to pay. Specifically, by considering the domain and technical challenges of investment recommendation, we first model the productsâ?? and investorsâ?? profiles, i.e, the estimated return and risk based on product attributes and investorsâ?? historical behaviors, which provides foundations for further recommendation. Then we generate a candidate investment recommendation list for each investor that tackles â??what to buyâ?? problem. In this process, we consider various unique properties of investment recommendation, e.g., the investorâ??s experience and his/her supporting groups. Furthermore, according to the modern portfolio theory, we optimize the shares of each recommended product by incorporating the investments an investor currently holds, thus solving the â??how much money to payâ?? problem. Finally, extensive experimental results on a large real world P2P lending platform show the effectiveness of our model under various evaluation metrics
