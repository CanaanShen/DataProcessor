By concentrating the marketing efforts on a few key customers, targeted marketing could make the promotion of the items (products) much easier and more cost-effective. On the other hand, viral marketing aims at finding a set of individuals (seeds) in the networks to maximize the word-of-mouth propagation of an item. However, these two marketing strategies can only exploit some specific characteristics of the social networks, and the problem of how to combine them together to build a better, stronger business is still open. To that end, in this paper, we propose a general approach for integrated marketing. Specifically, to market a given item, we first generate the item-specific candidate users by a recommendation algorithm, and then select the typical users who have the best balanced utility scores and consumption/social entropy. Next, treating typical users as targeted customers, we study the problem of maximizing information awareness in viral marketing with these constrained targets. Along this line, we define it as a constrained coverage maximization problem, and propose three solutions: GMIC, LMIC and QMIC. Finally, the extensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our integrated marketing approach could outperform the methods that consider only targeted marketing or viral marketing.
