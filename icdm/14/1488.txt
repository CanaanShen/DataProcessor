The problem can be described as the discovery of patterns in flow graphs that have sets of attributes associated with their nodes. A connection between nodes is represented as a directed edge. The amount of load that goes through a path between nodes, or the frequency of transmission of such load between nodes, is represented as edge weights. A heavyweight pattern is a sub-set of attributes, found in a dataset of attributed flow graphs, that are connected by edges and have a computed weight higher than an user-defined threshold. A new algorithm called AFGMiner is introduced, the first one to our knowledge that finds heavyweight patterns in a dataset of attributed flow graphs and associates each pattern with its occurrences. The paper also describes a new tool for compiler engineers, HEPMiner, that applies the AFGMiner algorithm to Profile-based Program Analysis modelled as a heavyweight pattern mining problem.
