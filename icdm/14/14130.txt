However, the shortness and informality of tweets leads to extreme sparsity vector representation with a large vocabulary, which makes the conventional topic models (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation) often fail to achieve high quality underlying topics. It is generally known that tweets are always showing up with rich user-generated hashtags, which are utilized as keywords in tweets to mark messages or to form conversation for topics. In this paper, instead of treating tweets as flat documents, we propose a novel topic model to modeling topics of tweets, denoted as Hashtag Graph based Topic Model (HGTM). By utilizing the statistics of hashtag relation information in our hashtag graph, HGTM establishes word semantic relations, even if they are not co-occurred within a specific tweet, which could alleviate the sparsity problem. In addition, we enhance the dependencies of both multiple terms and hashtags via latent variables (topics) learnt with our hashtag relation graph. Our investigation illustrates that the user-contributed hashtags could serve as weak supervision for topic modeling, and the relation between hashtags could reveal the semantic relation between tweets. We evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms on tweet (hashtag) clustering and hashtag classification problems. Experiments on the real-world twitter data set show that our model provides an effective solution to discover more distinct and coherent topics than the state-of-the-art baselines, and has a strong ability of controlling sparseness and noise in tweets.
