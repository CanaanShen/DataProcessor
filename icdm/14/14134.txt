Intuitively, the multiple labels are usually correlated in some semantic space while sharing the same input space. As a consequence, the multi-label learning process can be augmented significantly by exploiting the label correlations effectively. Most of the existing approaches share the limitations in that the label correlations are typically taken as prior knowledge, which may not depict the true dependencies among labels correctly; or they do not adequately address the issue of missing labels. In this paper, we propose an integrated framework that learns the correlations among labels while training the multi-label model simultaneously. Specifically, a low rank structure is adopted to capture the global correlations among labels. In addition, we incorporate a supplementary label matrix which augments the possibly incomplete label matrix by exploiting the label correlations. An alternating algorithm is then developed to solve the optimization problem. Extensive experiments are conducted on a number of image and text data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
