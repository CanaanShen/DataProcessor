So far, most attribution models that have been widely used in practice are rule-based. The drawback of such rule-based models lies in the fact that the rules are quite simple and intuitive. With the ever enhanced capability to tracking advertising impressions and users' interaction with the advertisement, data-driven multi-touch attribution models, which attempt to infer the contribution based on user interaction data, become an important research direction. We here propose a new data-driven attribution model based on survival theory. In addition to modeling the attribution, the proposed model is also able to predict the probability of users' `conversion', a feature that is desirable for optimizing advertising placement. We validate the proposed method with a real-world data set obtained from a commercial advertising monitor company. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed method is promising in both conversion prediction and attribution.
