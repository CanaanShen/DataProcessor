However, most existing MIL algorithms can only handle small- or moderate-sized data. In order to deal with the large scale problems in MIL, we propose two efficient and scalable MIL algorithms named miVLAD and miFV. They map the original MIL bags into new feature vector representations with their corresponding mapping functions. In this way, the new feature representations can obtain bag-level information, and meanwhile lead to excellent performances even with linear classifiers. In consequence, thanks to the low computational cost in the mapping step and the scalability of linear classifiers, miVLAD and miFV can handle large scale MIL data efficiently and effectively. Experiments show that miVLAD and miFV not only achieve comparable accuracy rates with state-of-the-art MIL algorithms, but have hundreds of times faster speed than other MIL algorithms. Moreover, our algorithms can also perform well when they adopt the default parameters without any parameter tuning, which is convenient for practical applications.
