In this paper, we propose an LDA-based topic model for analyzing topic-sentiment evolution over time. The main features of our approach are (i) modeling time jointly with topics and sentiments to characterize topic-sentiment variations over time, (ii) extract topic-specific sentiments for the whole data and not for each single document, providing an overall view of topic-sentiment correlation. We derive inference algorithm based on Gibbs Sampling process. Finally, we present results on reviews and news datasets showing interpretable trends and strong correlation with ground truth in particular for topic-sentiment evolution over time.
