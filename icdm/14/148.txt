We present a Joint Topic Viewpoint (JTV) probabilistic model to analyse the underlying divergent arguing expressions that may be present in a collection of contentious documents. The representation we put forward is an extension of the original Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). It aims to be domain and thesaurus-independent, e.g., does not rely on WordNet coverage. The conceived JTV has the potential of automatically carrying the tasks of extracting and clustering the arguing expressions according to the hidden topics they discuss and the embedded viewpoints they voice. Experiments are conducted on three types of contentious documents: polls, online debates and editorials. Qualitative and quantitative assessments of the modelâ??s output show a good capacity of JTV in handling different contentious issues comparing to a state-of-the-art method. Moreover, analysis of the experimental results shows the effectiveness of the proposed model to automatically and accurately detect recurrent and coherent patterns of arguing expressions.
