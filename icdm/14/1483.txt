Mobile networks enable users to post on social media services (e.g., Foursquare) from anywhere and anytime. This new phenomenon led to the emergence of a new line of work in the area of recommender systems, i.e., Point-of-Interest recommendation. In this paper, we address the problem of recommending POIs to users in a location-based social network. We claim to propose the first comprehensive model, called ST (Social Topic), to capture both the social and topic aspects of user check-ins in a single probabilistic model. Our proposed generative model not only profiles users' preferences, but also captures the nature of location-based social networks. We conduct experiments on real life data sets from Foursquare and Yelp. We evaluate the effectiveness of ST by evaluating the accuracy of top-k POI recommendation. The experimental results show that ST achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models in the areas of social network-based recommender systems, and exploits the power of the location-based social network that has never been utilized before.
