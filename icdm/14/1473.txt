Often, these entities form groups and are organised according to an latent structure. However, these groupings and structures are generally unknown and it can be difficult to identify them. Graph clustering is an important type of approach used to discover these vertex groups and the latent structure within graphs. Non-negative matrix factorisation has been successfully applied to many problems, including graph clustering. However, the formulations of existing non-negative matrix factorisation approaches for graph clustering can be overly relaxed and their groupings and results consequently difficult to interpret. Also, due to their relaxed formulations, existing algorithms may fail to discover the true latent structure and groupings and converge to extreme solutions. In this paper, we propose a new formulation of the graph clustering problem that results in clusterings that are easy to interpret. Combined with a novel algorithm, the clusterings are also more accurate than state-of-the-art algorithms for both generated and real datasets.
