Unlike promotional campaigns on TV or other traditional mass media platforms, campaigns on social media often appear in stealth modes. Campaign promoters often try to influence people's behaviors/opinions/decisions in a latent manner such that the readers are not aware that the messages they see are strategic campaign posts aimed at persuading them to buy target products/services. Readers take such campaign posts as just organic posts from the general public. It is thus important to discover such campaigns, their promoter accounts and how the campaigns are organized and executed as it can uncover the dynamics of Internet marketing. This discovery is clearly useful for competitors and also the general public. However, so far little work has been done to solve this problem. In this paper, we study this important problem in the context of the Twitter platform. Given a set of tweets streamed from Twitter based on a set of keywords representing a particular topic, the proposed technique aims to identify user accounts that are involved in promotion. We formulate the problem as a relational classification problem and solve it using typed Markov Random Fields (T-MRF), which is proposed as a generalization of the classic Markov Random Fields. Our experiments are carried out using three real-life datasets from the health science domain related to smoking. Such campaigns are interesting to health scientists, government health agencies and related businesses for obvious reasons. Our results show that the proposed method is highly effective.
