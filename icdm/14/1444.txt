However they are also filled with various fake news. Without verification, such information could spread promptly through social network and result in serious consequences. To evaluate news credibility on Microblog, we propose a hierarchical propagation model. We detect sub-events within a news event to describe detail aspects of a news. Thus, for a news event, a three-layer credibility network consisting of event, sub-events and messages can represent it from different scale and reveal vital information for credibility evaluation. After we link these entities with their semantic and social associations, the credibility value of each entity is propagated on this network to achieve the final evaluation result. We formulate this propagation as a graph optimization problem and provide a global optimal solution to it with an iteration algorithm. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets can show that the proposed model boosts the accuracy performance by more than 6% and F-score by more than 16% over the baseline method.
