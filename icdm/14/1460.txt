However, the extension of well-known results from many other classical patterns to sequences is not a trivial task. In this paper we study the notion of delta-freeness for sequences. While this notion has extensively been discussed for itemsets, this work is the first to extend it to sequences. We define an efficient algorithm devoted to the extraction of such patterns. Furthermore, we show the advantage of the delta-free sequences and highlight their importance when building sequence classifiers, and we show how they can be used to address the feature selection problem in statistical classifiers, as well as to build symbolic classifiers which optimizes both accuracy and earliness of predictions.
