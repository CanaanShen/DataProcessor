It is even unclear what should be outliers in a large heterogeneous network (e.g., outliers in the entire bibliographic network consisting of authors, titles, papers and venues). In this study, we propose an interesting class of outliers, query-based subnetwork outliers. Given a heterogeneous network, a user raises a query to retrieve a set of task-relevant subnetworks, among which, subnetworks outliers are those that significantly deviate from others (e.g., outliers of author groups among those studying "topic modeling"). We formalize the problem and propose a general framework. We first utilize frequent pattern mining techniques to retrieve relevant subnetworks according to a given user query, and then introduce the notion of subnetwork similarity that captures the proximity between two subnetworks by their membership distributions. We propose a ranking algorithm by constructing a factor graph model to calculate the outlierness for each retrieved subnetwork, and show that the proposed algorithm does not need to tune parameters for each query. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed method outperforms other baselines.
