The use of data mining tools to understand art has great promise as it is objective and operational. We have investigated the distribution of music from around the world: geographical ethnomusicology. We cast the problem as training a machine learning program to predict the geographical origin of pieces of music. This is a technically interesting problem as it has features of both classification and regression, and because of the spherical geometry of the surface of the Earth. Because of theses characteristics of the representation of geographical positions, most standard classification/regression methods cannot be directly used. Two methods that are applicable are K-Nearest Neighbors and Random forest regression, which are robust to the non-standard structure of data. We also investigated improving performance through use of bagging. We collected 1,142 pieces of music from 73 countries, and described them using 2 different sets of standard audio descriptors using MARSYAS. To estimate the performance of the models 10-fold cross validation was used in all experiments. All methods performed better than random - significant at P < 0.001. The experimental results indicate that Random forest regression produces significantly better results than KNN, and the use of bagging improves the performance of KNN. The best performing algorithm achieved a mean great circle distance error of 3,113 km.
