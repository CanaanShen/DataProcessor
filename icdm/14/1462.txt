The model uses the matrix factorization approach to collaborative filtering, and allows for time evolution by modeling each low-dimensional latent embedding as an independent multidimensional Brownian motion. Observations are modeled as a random variable from a distribution parameterized by the dot products of the respective pair of vectors at that moment in time. This is naturally interpreted as a Kalman filter with multiple interacting state space vectors. We also present a method for learning a dynamically evolving drift parameter for each location by modeling it as an exponentiated Brownian motion. Posterior intractability is handled with a variational approximation, which also preserves tractability for future prior calculations in a manner similar to the Kalman filter. We evaluate the model on several large datasets, providing quantitative evaluation on the 10 million Movielens and 100 million Netflix datasets and qualitative evaluation on a set of 39 million total stock returns across roughly 6500 companies between the years 1962-2014.
