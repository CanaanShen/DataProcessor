To accomplish this, we devise a two-stage technique that employs hierarchical clustering using a combination of graph clustering (community finding) and topic modelling as a first stage, followed by either another round of hierarchical clustering or an active learning approach as a second stage. We evaluate the performance of our method in terms of manual labelling effort, prediction quality and efficiency on three real-world datasets and demonstrate that classical approaches to text classification are not well suited for incident ticket texts.
