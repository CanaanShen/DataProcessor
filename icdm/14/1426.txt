This issue is especially critical for newly launched CF applications where observed ratings are too scarce to learn a good model to predict missing values. There could be, however, information from other related domains which are with relatively denser data that can be utilized. This paper proposes a transfer-learning based approach that exploits probabilistic matrix factorization model trained with variational expectation-maximization (VEM) to resolve data sparsity by using information from multiple auxiliary domains. We conduct experiments on several data combination and report significant improvements over state-of-the-art transfer-based models for collaborative filtering. The results also show that our framework is the only solution that can achieve acceptable performance when each user has only one single rating.
