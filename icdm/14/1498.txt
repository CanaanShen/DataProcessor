If we presume CM uses a valid formation of linkages between subjects and their options, obviously it can be employed to deal with the problem of link analysis and prediction (LAP). However, such a mapping is often not trivial and straightforward. Classic CM aims to describe and predict choices according to attributes of subjects and options. In LAP problems, the only available observations are links among objects whose attributes are often not accessible. Hence, we extend CM into a latent feature space to capacitate it for the requirements of LAP problems. Furthermore, the regular binary linkage assumption, i.e., ones for positive links and zeroes for negative links, usually does not conform to reality, as it is inappropriate to always assume any unobserved link to be truly negative. To tackle this issue, we take a weaker assumption to model observed links as unary data. Another difficulty is that latent features of different subjects or options may be quite heterogeneous. To model such unary linkages and heterogeneous latent features will surely violate the independent and identically distributed (IID) assumption adopted by conventional LAP approaches. To address such challenges, we propose a Bayesian heteroskedastic choice model to model the heterogeneity in LAP problems with non-IID assumptions. The empirical evaluation on several real-world datasets proves the superiority of our non-IID models.
