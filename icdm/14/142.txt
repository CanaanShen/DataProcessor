Previous studies devote their efforts to modeling simple statistical dependencies among cross-modal data, and constructing global transformations to project the heterogeneous data into a measurable subspace. However, the global projections can not appropriately adapt to the diverse contents, and the naturally existing multi-level semantic relevance in web data is ignored. In this paper, we study the problem of semantic coherent cross-modal retrieval, where the documents from different modalities are ranked by the semantic relevance to the queries. Accordingly, we propose TINA, a correlation learning method by adapTive hIerarchical semaNtic Aggregation. First, by joint modeling of content and ontology similarities, we build a semantic hierarchy to measure the multi-level semantic relation among cross-modal documents. Second, we optimize the structure risk objective function that involves the semantic coherence measurement, the local projection consistency and the complexity penalty of the local projections. A set of local linear projections are constructed, where each local projection encodes the correlation among a subset of similar and semantically relevant data, and they are adaptively aggregated by gating functions. Therefore, a better bias-variance trade-off and the semantic coherence can be achieved by TINA. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely used cross-modal datasets, i.e., NUS-WIDE and ICML-Challenge. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the-state-of-art methods, and achieves promising model capacities in adapting to the multilevel semantic relation and content divergence.
