They have been widely used to represent various network systems, such as social networks, biological networks and etc. Knowledge discovery on linked data is of great importance to many real applications. One of the major challenges of learning linked data is how to effectively and efficiently extract useful information from both node attributes and links in linked data. Current studies on this topic either use selected topological statistics to represent network structures, or linearly map node attributes and network structures to a shared latent feature space. However, while approaches based on statistics may miss critical patterns in network structure, approaches based on linear mappings may not be sufficient to capture the non-linear characteristics of nodes and links. To handle the challenge, we propose, to our knowledge, the first deep learning method to learn from linked data. A restricted Boltzmann machine model named LRBM is developed for representation learning on linked data. In LRBM, we aim to extract the latent feature representation of each node from both node attributes and network structures, non-linearly map each pair of nodes to the links, and use hidden units to control the mapping. The details of how to adapt LRBM for link prediction and node classification on linked data have also been presented. In the experiments, we test the performance of LRBM as well as other baselines on link prediction and node classification. Overall, the extensive experimental evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed LRBM model in mining linked data.
