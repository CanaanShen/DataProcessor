Compared with traditional user feedbacks such as comments and ratings, these specific emotion annotations are more accurate for expressing users' personal emotions. In this paper, we propose to exploit these users' emotion annotations for online news in order to track the evolution of emotions, which plays an important role in various online services. A critical challenge is how to model emotions with respect to time spans. To this end, we propose a time-aware topic modeling method for solving this problem. Specifically, we first develop a model named emotion-Topic over Time (eToT), in which we represent the topics of news as a Beta distribution over time and a multinomial distribution over emotions. While eToT can uncover the latent relationship among news, emotion and time directly, it cannot capture the dynamics of topics. Therefore, we further develop another model named emotion-based Dynamic Topic Model (eDTM), where we explore the state space model for tracking the dynamics of topics. In addition, we demonstrate that both eToT and eDTM could enable several potential applications, such as emotion prediction, emotion-based news recommendations and emotion anomaly detections. Finally, we validate the proposed models with intensive experiments with a real-world data set.
