With the increasing popularity of social media, these problems may be solved by using social-based recommendation. Social-based recommendation, as an emerging research area, uses social information to help mitigate the data sparsity and cold start problems, and it has been demonstrated that the social-based recommendation algorithms can efficiently improve the recommendation performance. However, few of the existing algorithms have considered using multiple types of relations within one social network. In this paper, we investigate the social-based recommendation algorithms on heterogeneous social networks and proposed Hete-CF, a Social Collaborative Filtering algorithm using heterogeneous relations. Distinct from the exiting methods, Hete-CF can effectively utilize multiple types of relations in a heterogeneous social network. In addition, Hete-CF is a general approach and can be used in arbitrary social networks, including event based social networks, location based social networks, and any other types of heterogeneous information networks associated with social information. The experimental results on two real-world data sets, DBLP (a typical Heterogeneous information network) and Meetup (a typical event based social network) show the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.
