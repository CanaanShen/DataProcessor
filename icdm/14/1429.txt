The corresponding explorative data analysis tasks, dimensionality reduction and clustering, have been first studied by our community as separate research topics. Later algorithms like CLIQUE, ORCLUS, 4C, etc. perform clustering and dimensionality reduction in a joint, simultaneous process to find clusters residing in low-dimensional subspaces. Such a low-dimensional representation is extremely useful, because it allows us to visualize the relationships between the various objects of a cluster. However, previous methods of subspace, correlation or projected clustering determine an individual subspace for each cluster. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is even much more valuable to find clusters in one common low-dimensional subspace, because then we can study not only the intra-cluster but also the inter-cluster relationships of objects, and the relationships of the whole clusters to each other. We develop the mathematical foundation ORT (Optimal Rigid Transform) to determine an arbitrarily oriented subspace, suitable for a given cluster structure. Based on ORT, we propose FOSSCLU (Finding the Optimal SubSpace for CLUstering), a new iterative clustering algorithm. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FOSSCLU outperforms the previous methods even in both aspects: clustering and dimensionality reduction.
