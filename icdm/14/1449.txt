Therefore, we propose a novel Sparse and Low-Rank Linear Method (LorSLIM) to capture such structures and apply this model to improve the accuracy of the Top-N recommendation. Precisely, a sparse and low-rank aggregation coefficient matrix W is learned from LorSLIM by solving an L1-norm and nuclear norm regularized optimization problem. We also develop an efficient alternating augmented Lagrangian method(ADMM) to solve the optimization problem. A comprehensive set of experiments is conducted to evaluate the performance of LorSLIM. The experimental results demonstrate the superior recommendation quality of the proposed algorithm in comparison with current state-of-the-art methods.
