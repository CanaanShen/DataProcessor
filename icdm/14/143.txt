Our aim is to monitor data streams statistically, and find subsequences that have the characteristics of a given hidden Markov model (HMM). For example, consider an online web-click stream, where massive amounts of access logs of millions of users are continuously generated every second. So how can we find meaningful building blocks and typical access patterns such as weekday/weekend patterns, and also, detect anomalies and intrusions? In this paper, we propose StreamScope, a fast and exact algorithm for monitoring multiple co-evolving data streams. Our method has the following advantages: (a) it is effective, leading to novel discoveries and surprising outliers, (b) it is exact, and we prove theoretically that StreamScope guarantees the exactness of the output, (c) it is fast, and requires O(1) time and space per time-tick. Our experiments on 67GB of real data illustrate that StreamScope does indeed detect the qualifying subsequence patterns correctly and that it can offer great improvements in speed (up to 479,000 times) over its competitors.
