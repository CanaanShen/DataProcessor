This intervention recommendation framework analyzes the complex interplay between the demographic, medical diagnoses, and clinical factors to infer and then recommend how certain interventions (procedures) lower the readmission risk for an individual patient. We design principled solutions by learning the structure and parameters of a multi-layer hierarchical Bayesian network from underlying high-dimensional patient data. Next, we generate and summarize the rules leading to personalized interventions which can be applied to individual patients as they progress from admit to discharge. Our proposed framework is flexible enough to include additional factors and physician specified constraints to embed domain expertise in the solution. While our primary effort is to design intervention strategies for HF, the proposed framework could also be adapted for other chronic conditions. We present comprehensive experimental results as well as interesting case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework using large real-world patient datasets. The entire framework is hosted as a cloud based service on Microsoft Azure for Research platform. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first effort to investigate predictive intervention recommendation to lower readmission risk due to heart failure leading to effective care-management and healthier outcomes
