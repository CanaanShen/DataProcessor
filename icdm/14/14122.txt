In this paper, we propose a novel model stability based stopping criterion, which considers the potential capability of each unlabeled examples to change the model once added to the training set. The underlying motivation is that active learning should terminate when the model cannot be changed too much by adding remaining examples. Inspired by the widely used stochastic gradient update rule, we use the gradient of the loss at each candidate example to measure its capability to change the classifier. Under the model change rule, we stop active learning when the changing ability of all remaining unlabeled examples is less than a given threshold. We apply the stability-based stopping criterion to two popular classifiers: logistic regression and support vector machines (SVMs). It can be generalized to a wide spectrum of learning models. Substantial experimental results on various UCI benchmark data sets have demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-art methods in most cases.
