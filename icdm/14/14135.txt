However, most of these marketing accounts merely focus on the contents of their tweets. Less effort has been made on understanding the effect of tweeting timing, which is a major contributing factor in terms of attracting customersâ?? attention and maximizing the influence of a social marketing campaign. To that end, in this paper, we provide a focused study of the temporal patterns and their influence on social media marketing campaigns. Specifically, we investigate the customersâ?? retweeting patterns by modeling their retweeting behaviors as a generative process, which considers temporal, social, and topical factors. Moreover, we validate the predictive power of the model on the dataset collected from Sina Weibo, the most popular microblog platform in China. Based on the learned model, we learn customers retweeting behaviors and recommend tweets to the customers in a time-aware manner. Also, we predict the potential users which may retweet a tweet given the time and the content of the tweet. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other baseline methods. This model is applicable for companies to conduct their marketing campaigns at the right time on social media.
