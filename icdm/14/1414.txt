An unknown value may represent a missing entry (lost or indeterminable) or something with meaning, like a Don't Know response in a questionnaire. In this paper we introduce an effectively- and efficiently-superior algorithm for reducing the dimensionality of logical data (categorical data in general) in the context of a new data mining challenge: Ternary Matrix Factorization (TMF). For a ternary data matrix, TMF exploits ternary logic to produce a basis matrix (which holds the major patterns in the data) and a usage matrix (which maps patterns to original observations). Both matrices are interpretable, and their ternary matrix product approximates the original matrix. TMF has applications in 1) finding targeted structure in ternary data, 2) imputing values through pattern-discovery in highly-incomplete categorical data sets, and 3) solving instances of its encapsulated Binary Matrix Factorization (BMF) problem. Our elegant algorithm FasTer (FASt TERnary Matrix Factorization) has linear run-time complexity with respect to the dimensions of the data set and is parameter-robust. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets show that we are able to efficiently and effectively outperform state-of-the-art techniques in all three TMF applications.
