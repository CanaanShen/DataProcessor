Similarity search depends crucially on choices of representation and similarity metric. There has been an explosion in the number and variety of similarity measures for time series, but this has not solved the problem of large scale similarity search in multivariate time series. No one metric consistently outperforms the rest, and many approaches fail to scale to really large data. We address this problem using kernelized hashing, which has been used with great success in image search. Because kernelized hashing can be combined with arbitrary kernel similarity metrics, it provides a general and agnostic approach to accelerating time series similarity searches. We combine kernelized locality-sensitive hashing with several representative time series similarity measures (old and new) and demonstrate the speed and accuracy of this approach on three large real world clinical data sets. We argue that this is a promising direction for fast time series similarity search.
