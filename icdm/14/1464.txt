Due to the statistical correlations between linked nodes in the network, many RML methods focus on predicting node features (i.e., labels) using the network relationships. However, many domains are comprised of a single, partially-labeled network. Thus, relational versions of Expectation Maximization (e.g., R-EM), which jointly learn parameters and infer the missing labels, can outperform methods that learn parameters from the labeled data and apply them for inference on the unlabeled nodes. Although R-EM methods can significantly improve predictive performance in networks that are densely labeled, they do not achieve the same gains in sparsely labeled networks and can perform worse than RML methods. In this work, we show the fixed-point methods that R-EM uses for approximate learning and inference result in errors that prevent convergence in sparsely labeled networks. We then propose two methods that do not experience this problem. First, we develop a Relational Stochastic EM (R-SEM) method, which uses stochastic parameters that are not as susceptible to approximation errors. Then we develop a Relational Data Augmentation (R-DA) method, which integrates over a range of stochastic parameter values for inference. R-SEM and R-DA can use any collective RML algorithm for learning and inference in partially labeled networks. We analyze their performance with two RML learners over four real world datasets, and show that they outperform independent learning, RML and R-EMâ?? particularly in sparsely labeled networks.
