In this paper, we extend Lasso to multiple output prediction, which belongs to the categories of structured learning. Though structured learning makes use of both input and output simultaneously, the joint feature mapping in current framework of structured learning is usually application specific, which is not ad hoc and thus lacks the generalization ability for tasks of multiple output prediction. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose to augment Lasso with the output feature by decouple the mapping function of traditional structured learning. The contribution of this paper is three-fold: 1) The augmented lasso conducts regression and variable selection on both the input and output features, and thus the learned model could fit an output with both the selected input variables and the other correlated outputs. 2) To be more general, we set up non- linear dependency among output variables by the generalized lasso. 3) Moreover, the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) with Alternating Direction Minimizing (ADM) strategy is used to find the optimal model parameters. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
