Automatic classification of phonemes is a well researched topic in linguistics for its potential for robust speech recognition. With recent advancement of phonetic segmentation algorithms, it is now possible to generate massive datasets of millions of phonemes automatically. Phoneme classification on such datasets is a challenging data mining task because of the large number of classes (over hundred) and complexities of the existing methods. In this paper, we introduce the phoneme classification problem as a data mining task. We propose a dual-domain (time and frequency domains) hierarchical classification algorithm. Our method uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) based classifier in the top layers and time-frequency features in the lower layer. We cross validate our method on phonemes from three online dictionaries and achieved upto 35% more accurate classification than existing techniques. We provide case studies on classifying accented phonemes and speaker invariant phoneme classification.
