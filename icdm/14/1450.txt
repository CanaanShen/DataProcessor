Kronecker models are appealing because of their elegant fractal structure, as well as their ability to capture important network characteristics such as degree, diameter, and (in the case of mKPGM) clustering and population variance. In addition, scalable sampling algorithms for KPGMs made the analysis of large-scale, sparse networks feasible for the first time. In this work, we show that the the scalable sampling methods, in contrast to prior belief, do not sample in fact from the underlying KPGM distribution and often result in sampling graphs that are very unlikely. To address this issue, we develop a new KPGM representation, which exploits its fractal structure, to facilitate the development of a novel grouped sampling process that is both efficient and provably correct. Moreover, we show that our proposed KPGM sampling algorithm is even faster than the previous scalable methods. Additionally, our representation extends to mKPGMs as well, enabling the first scalable sampling algorithm for mKPGM (which is also provably correct). We corroborate our theoretical results with empirical evaluation, showing that we can sample networks with 75 million edges in 87 seconds on a single processor.
