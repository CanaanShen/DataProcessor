Such recommendation should happen in real-time as new contents become available, because "freshness" is an important consideration in people's content-consumption behavior. Representing users and contents as feature vectors in a high-dimensional space, we can essentially cast the problem of real-time recommendations as the problem of computing the list of k nearest neighbors of each user, which we call kNN join. Given the vast volume of contents and users, the biggest challenge is how to continuously update the kNN join results as new contents arrive. Existing methods for incremental kNN join on data streams suffer from the "curse of dimensionality" and high in-memory search cost. In this paper, we present a solution that first identifies the users whose kNN's might be affected by the newly arrived content, and then update their kNN's respectively. We propose a new index structure named HDR-tree in order to support the efficient search of affected users. HDR-tree performs dimensionality reduction through clustering and principle component analysis (PCA) in order to improve the search effectiveness. To further reduce response time, we propose a variant of HDR-tree, called HDR*-tree, that supports more efficient but approximate solutions. The results of extensive experiments show that our methods significantly outperform baseline methods.
