We coin the term stream volatility, to describe and measure the rate of changes in a stream. A stream has a high volatility if changes are detected frequently and has a low volatility if changes are detected infrequently. We are particularly interested in a volatility shift which is a change in the rate of changes (e.g. from a high volatility to a low volatility). Knowing the volatility of a stream and when volatility shifts provide the users with an additional dimension of information beyond what traditional drift detection techniques can supply. We introduce and define the concept of stream volatility, and propose a novel technique to detect volatility on data streams in the presence of concept drifts. Since data stream environments are characterized by high volume and high velocity data, a memory efficient and fast running drift detection algorithm is necessary. Therefore, we also propose a new algorithm for drift detection called SEED which we show is both faster and more memory efficient than the existing state-of-the-art drift detection approach. A faster drift detection algorithm has a flow-on benefit to the subsequent volatility detection stage because both algorithms run concurrently on the data stream.
