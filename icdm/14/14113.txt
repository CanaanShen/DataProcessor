Most of the existing works mainly address on mining POIs by crowd power in LBSN and generate the recommendation on demand. For example, extracting personal preferences from individualâ??s location history to score the POIs in query region. However, they ignore the impact of social relations hidden in LBSN, i.e., the social influence from friends. We suppose that the location-aware recommendation with favorable comments from friends should be more reliable than that from unfamiliar crowd.In this paper, we propose a new social influencebased user recommender system (SIR) which differs from prior works by aiming to discover the potential value addition from reliable users (i.e. close friends and travel experts). Explicitly, our SIR system is able to infer influential users from LBSN. We claim to capture the interaction among virtual community, physical mobility activities and time effects to infer the social influence between user pairs. Furthetmore, we intend to model the propagation of influence in terms of diffusion-based mechanism. Third, we design a dynamic fusion framework to integrate the features mined into an united follow probability score. Finally, our framework provides personalized top-k user recommendation for individuals. To evaluate the recommendation results, we conduct extensive experiments on real datasets (i.e., Flicker dataset and Gowalla datasets). The experimental results shows the performance of our SIR system is better than a state-ofthe- art user recommendation mechanisms in terms of accuracy and reliability.
