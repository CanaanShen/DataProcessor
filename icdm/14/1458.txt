Compared to private transportation, public transportation uses road space more efficiently and produces fewer accidents and emissions. In this paper, we focus on the identification and optimization of flawed bus routes to improve utilization efficiency of public transportation services, according to people's real demand for public transportation. To this end, we first provide an integrated mobility pattern analysis between the location traces of taxicabs and the mobility records in bus transactions. Based on mobility patterns, we propose a localized transportation mode choice model, with which we can accurately predict the bus travel demand for different bus routing. This model is then used for bus routing optimization which aims to convert as many people from private transportation to public transportation as possible given budget constraints on the bus route modification. We also leverage the model to identify region pairs with flawed bus routes, which are effectively optimized using our approach. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, extensive studies are performed on real world data collected in Beijing which contains 19 million taxi trips and 10 million bus trips.
