In many real-world applications, it is common to find useful information from different channels/views to describe the objects, which naturally results in a new representation with multiple graphs generated from different feature views being used to describe one object. In this paper, we formulate a new Multi-Graph-View learning task for graph classification, where each object to be classified contains graphs from multiple graph-views. This problem setting is essentially different from traditional single-graph-view graph classification, where graphs are collected from one single feature view. To solve the problem, we propose a Cross Graph-View Subgraph Feature based Learning (gCGVFL) algorithm that explores an optimal set of subgraphs, across multiple graph-views, as features to represent graphs. Specifically, we derive an evaluation criterion to estimate the discriminative power and redundancy between subgraph features across all views, with a branch-and-bound algorithm being proposed to prune subgraph search space. Because graph-views may complement to each other and play different roles in a learning task, we assign each view with a weight value indicating its importance to the learning task, and further use an optimization process to find optimal weight values for each graph-view. The iterative cross graph-view subgraph scoring and graph-view weight updating forms a closed loop to find optimal subgraphs to represent graphs for multi-graph-view learning. Experiments and comparisons on real-world tasks demonstrate the algorithm's superior performance.
