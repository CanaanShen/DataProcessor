In this paper, given an entire season's worth of player and ball tracking data from a professional soccer league (over 100,000,000 data points), we present a method which can conduct both individual player and team analysis. Due to the dynamic, continuous and mutli-player/team nature of team sports like soccer, a major issue is aligning player positions over time. We show that our "role-based" representation that dynamically updates each player's relative position at each frame captures the short-term context to enable individual player analysis, in addition to providing extremely accurate and quick retrieval and clustering performance compared to density-based, greedy and exhaustive methods. We discover these set of roles directly from data by utilizing a minimum entropy data partitioning method.
