This drawback motivates the research problem in this paper: predicting aspect ratings and overall ratings for unrated reviews. To solve this problem, we novelly propose a topic model based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation with indirect supervision. Compared with the previous bag-of-words representation of review documents, we utilize the quad-tuples of (head, modifier, rating, entity) to explicitly model the associations between modifiers and ratings. Specifically, our solution for aspect mining in unrated reviews is decomposed into three steps. Firstly, ratable aspects are generated over sentiments from training reviews with overall ratings. Afterwards, inference of aspect identification and rating for unrated reviews are provided. Finally, overall ratings are predicted for unrated reviews. Under this framework, aspect and sentiment associations are captured in the form of joint probabilities through a generative process. The effectiveness of our approach is testified on a real-world dataset crawled from TripAdvisor, and extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
