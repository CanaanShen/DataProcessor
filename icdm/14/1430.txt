First, in many applications, the dimensionality is extremely high, in millions, and keeps growing. Second, feature selection has to be highly scalable, preferably in an online manner such that each feature can be accessed only once. In this paper, we develop SAOLA, a Scalable and Accurate OnLine Approach for feature selection. With a theoretical analysis on a low bound on the correlations between features in the currently selected feature subset, SAOLA employs novel online pairwise comparison techniques to address the two challenges and maintain a parsimonious model over time in an online manner. An empirical study using a series of benchmark real data sets shows that SAOLA is scalable on data sets of extremely high dimensionality, and has superior performance over the state-of-the-art feature selection methods.
