SSL techniques are often effective in text classi?cation, where labeled data is scarce but large unlabeled corpora are readily available. However, existing SSL tech- niques typically require multiple passes over the entirety of the unlabeled data, meaning the techniques are not applicable to large corpora being produced today.
