We support this hypothesis with experiments in cross-language (English-Italian) document categorization. In a straightforward bag-of-words experimental set-up we add etymological ancestors of the words in the documents, and investigate the performance of a model built on English data, on Italian test data (and viceversa). The results show not only statistically significant, but a large improvement ? a jump of almost 40 percentage points ? over the raw (vanilla bag-of-words) representation.
