In this paper, we propose Two-Neighbor Orientation model that jointly models orientation decisions between anchors and two neighboring multi unit chunks that cross phrase or rule boundaries. We explicitly model the longest span of such chunks, referred to as Maximal Orientation Span, to introduce global parameter that can guide underlying local decisions. We integrate our proposed model into a state-of-the-art string-to-dependency translation system and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal in a large-scale Chinese-to-English translation task. On NIST MT08 set, our most advanced model brings around +2.0 BLEU and
