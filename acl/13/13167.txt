We combine (i) features on source-side syntactic subcategorization and (ii) an external knowledge base with quantitative, dependency-based information about target-side subcategorization frames. A manual evaluation for an English-to-German translation task shows that the subcategorization information has a positive impact on translation quality through better prediction of syntactic case.
