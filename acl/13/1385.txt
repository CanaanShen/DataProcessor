We propose an extension of Hiero called Phrasal-Hiero to address Hiero's second problem. Phrasal-Hiero still has the same hypothesis space as the original Hiero but incorporates a phrase-based distance cost feature and lexicalized reodering features into the chart decoder. The work consists of two parts: 1) for each Hiero translation derivation, find its corresponding discontinuous phrase-based path. 2) Extend the chart decoder to incorporate features from the phrase-based path.  We achieve significant improvement over both Hiero and phrase-based baselines for Arabic-English, Chinese-English and German-English translation.
