As students read expository text, comprehension is improved by pausing to answer questions that reinforce the material. We describe an automatic question generator that uses semantic pattern recognition to create questions of varying depth and type for self-study or tutoring. Throughout, we explore how linguistic considerations inform system design. In the described system, semantic role labels of source sentences are used in a domain-independent manner to generate both questions and answers related to the source sentence. Evaluation results show a 44% reduction in the error rate relative to the best prior systems, averaging over all metrics, and up to 61% reduction in the error rate on grammaticality judgments.
