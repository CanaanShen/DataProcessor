Recent work on Chinese analysis has led to large-scale annotations of the internal structures of words, enabling character-level analysis of Chinese syntactic structures.
In this paper, we investigate the problem of character-level Chinese dependency parsing, building dependency trees over characters.
Character-level information can benefit downstream applications by offering flexible granularities for word segmentation while improving word-level dependency parsing accuracies.
We present novel adaptations of two major shift-reduce dependency parsing algorithms to character-level parsing.
Experimental results on the Chinese Treebank demonstrate improved performances over word-based parsing methods.
