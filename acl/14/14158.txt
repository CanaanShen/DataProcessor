This paper presents experiments with WordNet semantic classes to improve dependency parsing. We study
the effect of semantic classes in three dependency parsers, using two types of constituency-to-dependency conversions of the English Penn Treebank. Overall, we can say that the improvements are small and not significant using automatic POS tags, contrary to previously published results using gold POS tags [].
In addition, we explore parser combinations, showing that the semantically enhanced parsers yield a small significant gain only on the more semantically oriented LTH treebank conversion.
