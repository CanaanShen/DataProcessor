Following the works of \citeNCarletta96 and \citeNArt:Poe08, there is
an increasing consensus within the field that in order to properly gauge
the reliability of an annotation effort, chance-corrected measures of
inter-annotator agreement should be used. With this in mind, it is
striking that virtually all evaluations of syntactic annotation efforts
use uncorrected parser evaluation metrics such as bracket F1 (for
phrase structure) and accuracy scores (for dependencies).
