We present an approach to cross-language retrieval that combines dense
knowledge-based features and sparse word translations. Both feature types
are learned directly from relevance rankings of bilingual documents in a
pairwise ranking framework. In large-scale experiments for
patent prior art search and cross-lingual retrieval in Wikipedia,
our approach yields considerable improvements over learning-to-rank
with either only dense or only sparse features, and over very competitive
baselines that combine state-of-the-art machine translation and retrieval.
