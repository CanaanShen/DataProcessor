In this paper11This work was done while the first author was visiting SUTD., we address the problem of web-domain POS tagging using a two-phase approach.
The first phase learns representations that capture regularities underlying web text.
The representation is integrated as features into a neural network that serves as a scorer for an easy-first POS tagger.
Parameters of the neural network are trained using guided learning in the second phase.
Experiment on the SANCL 2012 shared task show that our approach achieves 93.27?% average tagging accuracy, which is the best accuracy reported so far on this data set, higher than those given by ensembled syntactic parsers.
