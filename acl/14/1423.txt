We present a simple, data-driven approach to generation from knowledge
bases (KB). A key feature of this approach is that grammar induction
is driven by the extended domain of locality principle of TAG (Tree
Adjoining Grammar); and that it takes into account both syntactic and
semantic information. The resulting extracted TAG includes a
unification based semantics and can be used by an existing surface
realiser to generate sentences from KB data. Experimental evaluation
on the KBGen data shows that our model outperforms a data-driven
generate-and-rank approach based on an automatically induced
probabilistic grammar; and is comparable with a handcrafted symbolic
approach.
